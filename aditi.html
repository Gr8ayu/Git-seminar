23 January 2020 â€“ A new WHO self-help approach for managing distress and coping with adversity has shown to be safe and effective in a trial involving South Sudanese women living in Uganda. The results of the study, published in The Lancet Global Health today, indicate that guided self-help could be a promising strategy to address the vast gap in mental health support in humanitarian response situations. WHO will make the self-help intervention available for widespread use once positive results have been seen in a second trial.
